# Test Case

## Definition

A **Test Case** is a specification of a set of test inputs, execution preconditions, expected results (outputs), and execution postconditions, developed for a particular objective or test condition, such as to exercise a specific program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement.

## Key Components

A formal test case typically includes:

1.  **Identifier:** A unique ID for tracking and reference.
2.  **Objective/Purpose:** What requirement, feature, or condition this test case aims to verify.
3.  **Preconditions:** Any conditions that must be true *before* the test can be executed (e.g., user logged in, specific data exists in database, system in a certain state).
4.  **Test Inputs/Steps:** The specific sequence of actions to perform or data values to input.
5.  **Expected Results/Outputs:** The specific, observable outcome(s) expected if the software behaves correctly according to the objective (e.g., specific screen display, calculated value, database state change, error message).
6.  **Postconditions:** The state of the system *after* the test case has been executed (may be the same as preconditions or different).
7.  **(Optional) Actual Results:** Recorded during test execution.
8.  **(Optional) Pass/Fail Status:** Determined by comparing actual results to expected results.
9.  **(Optional) Environment/Setup:** Specific hardware/software configuration needed.

## Purpose

- **Verification & Validation:** Provide concrete steps to check if the software meets requirements ([[Verification]]) and user expectations ([[Validation]]).
- **Defect Detection:** Designed to expose [[Failures_Faults_Errors|faults]] by creating conditions under which incorrect behavior (failures) might occur.
- **Repeatability:** Allows tests to be executed consistently by different testers or automation tools.
- **Traceability:** Can be linked back to specific requirements or design elements.
- **Test Coverage:** A suite of test cases aims to achieve adequate [[Test_Coverage]].

## Examples

**Simple Test Case Example:**

- **ID:** TC_LOGIN_001
- **Objective:** Verify successful login with valid credentials.
- **Preconditions:** User account "testuser" exists with password "password123". Application login page is displayed.
- **Steps:**
    1. Enter "testuser" into the username field.
    2. Enter "password123" into the password field.
    3. Click the "Login" button.
- **Expected Results:** User is redirected to the dashboard page. Welcome message "Welcome, testuser!" is displayed.
- **Postconditions:** User is logged in.
