# Testing vs. Debugging

## Definition

**Testing** and **Debugging** are distinct but related activities in the software development process, both aimed at improving software quality, but with different goals and approaches.

-   **[[Software_Testing|Testing]]:** The process of **finding defects** ([[Failures_Faults_Errors|failures/faults]]). It involves executing the software with the intent to identify discrepancies between expected and actual behavior, verifying requirements, and assessing quality. Testing *identifies* that a problem exists.
-   **[[Debugging_Techniques_C|Debugging]]:** The process of **locating and fixing the faults** (bugs) that cause observed failures identified during testing or reported by users. It involves analyzing the code, understanding the root cause of the failure, and implementing a correction. Debugging *diagnoses and removes* the cause of the problem.

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Testing                                       | Debugging                                         |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Goal**| Find defects / failures                       | Find root cause (fault) & fix it                  |
| **Input**       | Requirements, specifications, code, test cases| Failure reports, test results, source code        |
| **Process**     | Planned, designed execution (often scripted)  | Investigative, analytical, iterative (often ad-hoc)|
| **Outcome**     | Failure reports, test logs, quality assessment| Code correction (fix), understanding of the fault |
| **Who Performs**| Testers, Developers (unit/integration tests)  | Developers                                        |
| **Timing**      | Can start early (static), dynamic during/after coding | Occurs *after* a failure has been detected      |
| **Mindset**     | Find what's wrong                             | Understand *why* it's wrong and fix it            |
| **Automation**  | Highly automatable                            | Less easily automated (analysis is key)           |

## Relationship

Testing feeds debugging. Testing activities generate failure reports or identify failing test cases. These failures become the starting point for the debugging process. After a developer fixes a fault (debugs), further testing (confirmation testing and [[Regression_Test|regression testing]]) is required to ensure the fix works and hasn't introduced new problems.
