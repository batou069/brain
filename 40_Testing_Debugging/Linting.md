# Linting

## Definition

**Linting** is the process of running a program (a **Linter**) that performs **[[Static_Analysis]]** on source code to flag potential programming errors, stylistic errors, suspicious constructs, and deviations from prescribed coding standards or conventions. The original `lint` program was developed for C code in the late 1970s.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Type of Static Analysis:** Linting is a specific category of [[Static_Analysis]].
- **Focus:** Primarily targets:
    - **Potential Errors:** Suspicious code that might not be a syntax error but could lead to bugs (e.g., unused variables, potential null pointer issues, unreachable code).
    - **Stylistic Issues:** Violations of code formatting and style guidelines (e.g., inconsistent indentation, line length limits, naming conventions).
    - **Code Smells:** Patterns that might indicate deeper problems in the code's structure or maintainability.
- **Automated Tools (Linters):** Performed by linter tools specific to programming languages (e.g., Pylint, Flake8, MyPy for Python; ESLint, JSHint for JavaScript; Checkstyle for Java; `gcc -Wall -Wextra` acts partly as a linter for C).
- **Configuration:** Linters are often highly configurable, allowing teams to enforce specific coding standards (like [[PEP_8]] for Python) and enable/disable specific checks.
- **Goal:** Improve code quality, readability, maintainability, and consistency, and catch simple errors early before runtime testing.
- **Not Deep Bug Finding:** Linters typically focus on stylistic issues and relatively simple potential errors, rather than complex logic flaws or security vulnerabilities (though some overlap exists with more advanced static analyzers).

## Examples / Use Cases

- Running `flake8 my_code.py` to check for [[PEP_8]] violations and simple errors in Python code.
- Integrating ESLint into a JavaScript development workflow to enforce consistent style and catch common pitfalls.
- Configuring a C compiler with flags like `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic` to enable extensive warnings that act like lint checks.
