# Validation

## Definition

**Validation** is the process of evaluating a software system or component during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements and meets the user's actual needs and expectations in its intended operational environment. In essence, it answers the question: **"Are we building the right product?"**

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Focus:** Fitness for purpose, meeting user needs, fulfilling business objectives, satisfying requirements from the user's perspective.
- **Timing:** Often occurs later in the development cycle, involving dynamic testing on integrated systems.
- **Activities:** Includes activities like:
    - [[System_Test|System testing]]
    - [[Acceptance_Test|Acceptance testing]] (User Acceptance Testing - UAT, Business Acceptance Testing - BAT)
    - Usability testing
    - Beta testing
    - Demonstrations to stakeholders
- **Goal:** To ensure the developed software actually solves the intended problem and is usable by the end-users.

## Validation vs. Verification

- **[[Verification]]:** Are we building the product *right*? (Conformance to spec)
- **Validation:** Are we building the *right* product? (Fitness for purpose, meets user needs)

Both are essential parts of [[Software_Testing]] and quality assurance. A product can be verified (perfectly matches a flawed specification) but not validated (doesn't meet user needs). Conversely, a product might meet user needs (validated) but deviate from the original specification (failed verification).
