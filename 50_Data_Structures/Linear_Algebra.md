# Linear Algebra

## Definition

**Linear Algebra** is a branch of mathematics concerning linear equations, linear maps (transformations), and their representations in vector spaces and through matrices. It is fundamental to many areas of science, engineering, computer graphics, machine learning, and data science.

## Core Concepts (Covered in WS11)

Key objects and operations in linear algebra include:

-   **[[Vector_Math|Vectors]]:** Geometric objects with magnitude and direction, often represented as arrays of numbers (coordinates). Used to represent points, displacements, features, etc.
-   **[[Matrix_Math|Matrices]]:** Rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Used to represent linear transformations, systems of linear equations, and datasets.
-   **[[Matrix_Operations|Matrix Operations]]:** Addition, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transpose.
-   **[[Dot_Product|Dot Product]] (Inner Product):** An operation on two vectors yielding a scalar value.
-   **[[Matrix_Determinant|Determinants]]:** A scalar value associated with a square matrix, indicating properties like invertibility.
-   **[[Matrix_Inverse|Matrix Inverse]]:** For some square matrices, an inverse matrix exists which, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the [[Identity_Matrix]].
-   **[[Identity_Matrix|Identity Matrix]]:** The multiplicative identity for matrices.
-   **[[Matrix_Trace|Trace]]:** The sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix.
-   Properties: [[Distributive_Law_Matrix]], [[Commutativity_Matrix]], [[Associativity_Matrix]].

## Relevance to AI/Data Science

Linear algebra is essential for:
- Representing data (feature vectors, datasets as matrices).
- Dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, SVD).
- Machine learning algorithms (linear regression, support vector machines, neural network weight matrices).
- Optimization problems.
- Computer graphics and image processing.

## Related Concepts (Broader)
- Vector Spaces

- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Calculus (often used alongside linear algebra in optimization)
- Probability & Statistics (used in data analysis and ML models)
