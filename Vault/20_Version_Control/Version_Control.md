# Version Control

## Definition

**Version Control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, tracks who made which changes, and provides mechanisms to revert changes or merge different versions.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **History Tracking:** Records the evolution of files, allowing retrieval of any past version.
- **Collaboration:** Enables multiple users to work on the same project concurrently without overwriting each other's work (usually).
- **Branching & Merging:** Allows developers to work on different features or fixes in isolation ([[Branching]]) and later combine their changes ([[Merging]]).
- **Reversibility:** Makes it easy to undo changes or revert the entire project to a previous state.
- **Auditing:** Tracks *what* changes were made, *when*, and by *whom*.
- **Backup/Recovery:** The repository itself acts as a backup. Distributed systems ([[Distributed_Version_Control]]) provide inherent redundancy.

## Examples / Use Cases

- **Software Development:** Managing source code is the most common use case ([[Git]], Subversion, Mercurial).
- **Document Writing:** Tracking revisions of documents, articles, books (often using systems integrated with word processors or specialized VCS like Git).
- **Configuration Management:** Tracking changes to system configuration files.
- **Web Development:** Managing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend code.

> - **History:** Provides a complete history of changes, enabling understanding of project evolution and debugging.
> - **Revertibility:** Easy to undo mistakes or go back to working versions.
> - **Branching:** Supports parallel development of features or fixes without interference.
> - **Traceability/Accountability:** Shows who made specific changes and when.
> - **Backup:** The repository history serves as a backup. Distributed systems add redundancy.
