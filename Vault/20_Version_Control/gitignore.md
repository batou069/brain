# `.gitignore`

## Definition

A `.gitignore` file is a text file placed in a Git [[Repository]] that tells Git **which files or directories it should intentionally ignore**. Files listed in `.gitignore` (that are not already tracked by Git) will not be staged by commands like `git add .` or `git add -A`, and they won't show up in the output of `git status` as untracked files.

## Purpose

- **Exclude Generated Files:** Prevent committing files generated by compilers, build systems, or IDEs (e.g., object files `.o`, executables, log files `.log`, temporary files `~`, IDE configuration folders like `.vscode/`, `.idea/`).
- **Exclude Dependencies:** Avoid committing downloaded dependencies (e.g., `node_modules/`, Python `venv/` or `__pycache__/`) that should be managed by package managers.
- **Exclude Sensitive Information:** Prevent accidentally committing files containing passwords, API keys, or other sensitive credentials (though sensitive data shouldn't ideally be in the working directory at all).
- **Reduce Repository Size:** Keep the repository focused on source code and essential project files, avoiding large binary or generated files.
- **Clean `git status` Output:** Keep the status output clean by hiding irrelevant untracked files.

## Syntax Rules

- Each line specifies a pattern.
- Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored (comments).
- Standard glob patterns (like shell wildcards) work:
    - `*` matches zero or more characters (except `/`).
    - `?` matches any single character (except `/`).
    - `[...]` matches any one character in the brackets.
    - `**` matches zero or more directories (e.g., `**/logs` matches `logs` in any subdirectory).
- A leading `/` anchors the pattern to the repository root.
- A trailing `/` specifies a directory; Git will ignore the directory and everything inside it.
- A leading `!` negates a pattern; files matching a negated pattern *will* be tracked even if they match a previous ignore pattern.

## Location and Scope

- A `.gitignore` file can be placed in **any directory** within the repository.
- Patterns in a `.gitignore` file apply to the directory it's in and all subdirectories recursively.
- Patterns in a subdirectory's `.gitignore` file override patterns in parent directories for files within that subdirectory.
- A **global `.gitignore`** file can be configured (`git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`) to ignore files across *all* repositories for the user (e.g., OS-specific files like `.DS_Store`).

## Example `.gitignore` File

```gitignore
# Compiled files
*.o
*.obj
*.exe
*.dll
*.so
*.class

# Log files
*.log
logs/

# Dependency directories
node_modules/
vendor/
venv/
__pycache__/

# IDE / Editor config
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*~

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Sensitive data (example - better to not have these files at all)
credentials.json
*.key

# Exception: Track a specific needed file within an ignored directory
!node_modules/my-package/important.js
```

## Questions / Further Study
>[!question] Why do we need `.gitignore`? (WS2)
> We need `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally adding and tracking files that shouldn't be part of the project's version history. This includes files generated during the build process (like compiled code), downloaded dependencies (managed externally), operating system artifacts, temporary editor files, and sensitive configuration files. Keeping these files out of the repository makes the history cleaner, reduces repository size, avoids merge conflicts on generated files, and prevents sensitive data exposure.
