# Remote Repository (Git)

## Definition

In [[Git]] (and other [[Distributed_Version_Control|DVCS]]), a **Remote Repository** (or simply **remote**) refers to a version of your project [[Repository]] that is hosted somewhere else, typically on a network server or a dedicated hosting platform (like [[GitHub]], [[GitLab]], [[Bitbucket]]). Remotes serve as common points for collaboration, synchronization, and backup.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Hosted Elsewhere:** Resides on a different machine or server accessible via a URL (HTTPS or SSH).
- **Collaboration Hub:** Allows multiple developers to share their work by pushing their local changes to the remote and pulling changes made by others from the remote.
- **Local Representation (`git remote`):** Your local repository manages connections to remote repositories using **remotes**, which are essentially bookmarks consisting of a short **name** (e.g., `origin`) and a **URL**. The [[git_remote]] command manages these connections.
- **`origin`:** The conventional default shortname given to the remote repository from which you originally [[git_clone|cloned]].
- **Remote-Tracking Branches:** Your local repository keeps track of the state of branches on the remote repository using *remote-tracking branches* (e.g., `origin/main`, `origin/develop`). These are updated when you run [[git_fetch]] or [[git_pull]]. They reflect the state of the remote branches *the last time you communicated* with the remote.
- **Interaction:** You interact with remotes using commands like:
    - [[git_clone]]: To create a local copy of a remote repository.
    - [[git_fetch]]: To download changes *from* a remote without merging.
    - [[git_pull]]: To download changes *from* a remote and merge/rebase them.
    - [[git_push]]: To upload local changes *to* a remote.
    - [[git_remote]]: To manage the list of configured remotes.

## Purpose

- Share code and collaborate with other developers.
- Back up your local repository history.
- Synchronize work across multiple machines you use.
- Facilitate workflows involving code reviews ([[Merge_request]]) via hosting platforms.
