# Service Virtualization

## Definition

**Service Virtualization** is a technique used in testing and development to **simulate the behavior** of specific components within a heterogeneous, component-based application environment, such as API-driven applications, cloud-based applications, or [[Microservices|microservice architectures]]. It involves creating virtual assets (simulated services) that mimic the behavior, data, and performance characteristics of unavailable, unstable, or costly dependent systems (e.g., third-party APIs, mainframes, backend services not yet developed).

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Simulates Dependencies:** Creates virtual stand-ins for real service dependencies.
- **Focus on Behavior & Data:** Aims to accurately model the request/response behavior, data formats, and potentially performance characteristics (latency, errors) of the real service based on specified inputs or scenarios.
- **Beyond Simple Stubs/Mocks:** Often more sophisticated than basic [[Stubs]] or [[Mocks]], capable of handling complex protocols (beyond simple HTTP), managing state across multiple interactions, simulating performance variations, and providing realistic test data.
- **Enables Early & Parallel Testing:** Allows teams to test applications even when dependent services are:
    - Still under development.
    - Unstable or unreliable in test environments.
    - Unavailable due to access constraints or cost (e.g., pay-per-use third-party APIs).
    - Difficult to configure for specific test scenarios (e.g., specific error conditions).
- **Test Environment Management:** Simplifies the setup and management of complex test environments by replacing numerous real dependencies with easily configurable virtual ones.
- **Tools:** Typically implemented using specialized service virtualization tools (commercial or open-source).

## Examples / Use Cases

- Testing a mobile application's interaction with backend APIs before the APIs are fully developed or deployed.
- Performing [[Integration_Test|integration testing]] of a microservice without needing to deploy all its dependent microservices.
- Running performance tests against an application where a slow third-party API dependency is simulated to respond quickly, isolating the application's own performance.
- Testing complex error handling scenarios by configuring the virtual service to return specific error codes or malformed responses.

## Related Concepts
- [[Simulator]] (Service virtualization is a specific type of simulation focused on services/APIs)
- [[Emulator]] (Different; emulators mimic hardware)
- [[Stubs]], [[Mocks]] (Simpler forms of test doubles; service virtualization is often more comprehensive)
- [[API_Testing]], [[Integration_Test]], [[System_Test]]
- [[Microservices]], Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Test Environment Management
