# Test Plan

## Definition

A **Test Plan** is a formal document that describes the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended [[Software_Testing]] activities. It identifies, among other things, the items to be tested, the features to be tested, the testing tasks, who will do each task, the degree of tester independence, the test environment, the test design techniques and entry/exit criteria to be used, and the rationale for their choice, and any risks requiring contingency planning.

## Purpose

- **Guide Testing Efforts:** Provides a roadmap and framework for the entire testing process for a project or release.
- **Communication:** Communicates the testing strategy, scope, and schedule to stakeholders (developers, managers, clients).
- **Planning & Management:** Facilitates planning of resources (people, tools, environments), scheduling of activities, and tracking of progress.
- **Risk Management:** Identifies potential risks related to testing and outlines mitigation or contingency plans.
- **Baseline:** Serves as a baseline document against which testing progress and success can be measured.

## Typical Contents (Based on IEEE 829 Standard / Common Practice)

1.  **Test Plan Identifier:** Unique ID.
2.  **Introduction:** Overview of the project, document purpose, scope.
3.  **Test Items:** List of software items/features to be tested.
4.  **Features to be Tested:** Detailed list of functionalities included in the testing scope.
5.  **Features Not to be Tested:** Explicit list of functionalities excluded from testing and rationale.
6.  **Approach/Strategy:** Overall testing strategy, levels of testing (unit, integration, system, etc.), types of testing (functional, performance, security, etc.), test design techniques to be used.
7.  **Item Pass/Fail Criteria:** Definition of what constitutes a pass or fail for a test item or test case.
8.  **Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements:** Conditions under which testing will be suspended (e.g., critical build failure) and criteria for resuming.
9.  **Test Deliverables:** List of documents, tools, or artifacts produced by the testing process (e.g., test cases, test scripts, test reports, defect reports).
10. **Testing Tasks:** Breakdown of specific tasks involved (e.g., plan, design, execute, report).
11. **Environmental Needs:** Required hardware, software, tools, network configurations, test data.
12. **Responsibilities:** Roles and responsibilities of team members involved in testing.
13. **Staffing and Training Needs:** Skills required, training plans.
14. **Schedule:** Milestones, timelines for testing activities.
15. **Risks and Contingencies:** Potential risks (e.g., schedule delays, resource unavailability, unstable environment) and planned responses.
16. **Approvals:** Sections for stakeholder sign-off.
