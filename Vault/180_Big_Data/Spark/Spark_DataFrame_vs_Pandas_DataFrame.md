# Spark DataFrame vs. Pandas DataFrame

While both Apache Spark DataFrames (`pyspark.sql.DataFrame`) and Pandas DataFrames (`pandas.DataFrame`) provide powerful, tabular data structures with rich APIs for data manipulation, they are designed for different execution environments and scales.

>[!question] What is the difference between a Spark DataFrame and a Pandas DataFrame?

[list2tab|#Spark DF vs Pandas DF]
- Feature
    - Pandas DataFrame (`pandas.DataFrame`)
        - Spark DataFrame (`pyspark.sql.DataFrame`)
- **Execution Environment**
    - **Single-Node:** Operates on a single machine. All data and computations are typically held in the memory of that machine.
    -   **Distributed:** Operates on a cluster of machines. Data is partitioned and computations are executed in parallel across multiple nodes.
- **Data Storage**
    - **In-Memory (Primarily):** Designed to hold the entire dataset in the RAM of a single machine. Can struggle with datasets larger than available memory.
    -   **Distributed & In-Memory/Disk:** Data is distributed across the cluster. Spark can perform operations in memory across nodes, but it can also spill data to disk and process datasets much larger than the aggregate RAM of the cluster.
- **Mutability**
    - **Mutable (Value Mutability):** Values within a Pandas DataFrame can be changed in place (e.g., `df.loc[0, 'colA'] = new_value`). Operations often return new DataFrames by default unless `inplace=True` is used.
    -   **Immutable:** Spark DataFrames are immutable. [[Spark_Transformations_Actions|Transformations]] on a DataFrame create a *new* DataFrame. This aids in fault tolerance and reasoning about lineage.
- **[[Spark_Lazy_vs_Eager_Execution|Execution Model]]**
    - **Eager:** Most operations are executed immediately, and the result is available right away.
    -   **Lazy:** [[Spark_Transformations_Actions|Transformations]] are lazily evaluated. They build up a [[Spark_DAG_Scheduler|DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)]] of operations, which is only executed when an [[Spark_Transformations_Actions|action]] is called.
- **API Style**
    - Rich, imperative API with many convenient methods. Very flexible for interactive data exploration on moderately sized data.
    -   Declarative API (similar to SQL in spirit). Users define *what* they want, and Spark's [[Catalyst_Optimizer_Spark|Catalyst optimizer]] determines *how* to execute it efficiently. API is similar to Pandas but adapted for distributed execution.
- **Performance & Scalability**
    - **High performance for single-node operations** on datasets that fit in memory. Performance degrades significantly for out-of-core processing. Not designed for horizontal scaling.
    -   **Designed for scalability and performance on very large datasets** (terabytes, petabytes). Leverages distributed parallel processing. Overhead for small datasets might make it slower than Pandas for those cases.
- **Fault Tolerance**
    - **Not inherently fault-tolerant.** If the process crashes, data in memory is lost (unless saved).
    -   **Fault-tolerant.** Built on [[RDD_Resilient_Distributed_Dataset|RDDs]], which can reconstruct lost partitions using lineage information from the DAG.
- **Schema**
    - Flexible schema. Data types can be mixed more freely within columns initially, though often inferred or set.
    -   **Schema-enforced.** Requires a well-defined schema. This allows for significant optimizations by the Catalyst optimizer.
- **Underlying Technology**
    - Built on top of [[_NumPy_MOC|NumPy]] for efficient numerical operations.
    -   Built on top of [[RDD_Resilient_Distributed_Dataset|RDDs]]. Leverages Catalyst optimizer and Tungsten execution engine for optimized distributed query processing.
- **Typical Use Cases**
    - Interactive data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling on **datasets that fit comfortably in a single machine's memory**. Quick prototyping.
    -   Processing and analyzing **very large datasets (Big Data)** that require a distributed computing environment. ETL, batch processing, large-scale machine learning, SQL-like queries on massive data.
- **Ease of Use for Small Data**
    - Generally considered easier and more intuitive for quick, interactive analysis of smaller datasets due to eager execution and direct manipulation.
    -   Can have more setup overhead (SparkSession) and the lazy evaluation model might be less intuitive initially for users accustomed to Pandas.
- **Converting Between Them**
    - `spark_df.toPandas()`: Converts a Spark DataFrame to a Pandas DataFrame. **Warning: Collects all data to the driver node's memory, can cause OutOfMemoryError for large Spark DFs.**
    - `spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)`: Converts a Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame. Data is distributed across the cluster.

## When to Use Which?
-   **Use Pandas DataFrame if:**
    -   Your data fits comfortably in the RAM of a single machine.
    -   You need quick, interactive analysis and manipulation with immediate results.
    -   You are working in a single-node environment.
    -   You need the extensive and mature ecosystem of single-node Python libraries that integrate well with Pandas.
-   **Use Spark DataFrame if:**
    -   Your data is too large to fit in the memory of a single machine (Big Data).
    -   You need to perform distributed processing across a cluster for performance and scalability.
    -   Fault tolerance for long-running computations is critical.
    -   You are already working within the Spark ecosystem (e.g., reading from HDFS, integrating with Spark MLlib or Streaming).

It's also common to use them together: perform initial exploration or smaller computations with Pandas on a sample of data, then scale up processing using Spark DataFrames for the full dataset. Spark also supports Pandas UDFs, which allow applying Pandas logic in a distributed manner on Spark DataFrames.
