# Spark vs. Hadoop MapReduce

Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce are both frameworks for distributed processing of [[Big_Data_Definition_Characteristics|Big Data]], but they have significant differences in their architecture, performance characteristics, and capabilities. Spark is often considered a successor or a more advanced alternative to Hadoop's original MapReduce engine for many use cases.

>[!question]- What is the difference between Hadoop and Spark?
>This question often implicitly means "What is the difference between Hadoop MapReduce (the processing engine) and Apache Spark?" It's important to note that **Spark can run on top of Hadoop components** like [[HDFS|HDFS]] (for storage) and [[YARN|YARN]] (for resource management). So, they are not always mutually exclusive but can be complementary.
>
>If "Hadoop" refers to the entire Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, etc.), then Spark is a processing engine that can be *part of* or *integrate with* that ecosystem.
>
>The primary comparison is usually between **Spark's processing engine** and **Hadoop's MapReduce processing engine**.

[list2mdtable|#MapReduce vs Spark]
- Aspect
    - Hadoop MapReduce
	    - Spark
- Processing Model
	- **Batch-oriented:** Designed for processing large datasets in discrete batches. Each job is typically a sequence of Map and Reduce phases.
		- **More versatile:** Supports batch processing, iterative algorithms, interactive queries, and stream processing. More flexible data flow using a [[Spark_DAG_Scheduler|DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)]].
- Data Processing Speed & In-Memory Capability
	- **Disk-based:** Intermediate data between Map and Reduce phases is typically written to and read from disk ([[HDFS|HDFS]] or local disk). This leads to higher latency.
		- **In-memory processing (primarily):** Spark can cache intermediate data in memory across multiple operations ([[Spark_Persistence_Caching|RDD/DataFrame persistence]]). This significantly reduces disk I/O and makes it much faster for iterative algorithms and interactive analysis (reportedly up to 10-100x faster for certain workloads). Can spill to disk if memory is insufficient.
- [[Spark_Lazy_vs_Eager_Execution|Execution Model]]
	- **Strict Map -> Reduce flow:** Each MapReduce job follows a relatively rigid structure. Complex workflows require chaining multiple MapReduce jobs, with HDFS reads/writes between each job.
		- **[[Spark_Lazy_vs_Eager_Execution|Lazy evaluation]] with a flexible [[Spark_DAG_Scheduler|DAG]]:** Transformations build up a DAG, which is executed when an action is called. Allows for more complex, multi-stage operations within a single job and more optimization opportunities.
- Ease of Use & API
	- **Lower-level API (Java):** Writing native MapReduce jobs in Java can be verbose and complex, requiring significant boilerplate code.
		- **Higher-level APIs:** Provides rich APIs in Scala, Java, Python (PySpark), and R. The [[Spark_DataFrame_SQL|DataFrame/Dataset API]] and Spark SQL offer more concise and expressive ways to work with structured data.
- Iterative Algorithms
	- **Inefficient:** Each iteration typically requires a separate MapReduce job, leading to repeated HDFS reads/writes of the entire dataset.
		- **Efficient:** In-memory caching of data makes Spark well-suited for iterative algorithms (common in machine learning, graph processing) as data can be reused across iterations without costly disk I/O.
- Real-time/Stream Processing
	- **Not designed for it:** MapReduce is fundamentally a batch system. Other tools in the Hadoop ecosystem (like Storm, Flink, or specialized streaming solutions) were needed for stream processing.
		- **Built-in support:** [[Spark_Streaming_Structured_Streaming|Spark Streaming (older DStreams) and Structured Streaming]] provide robust capabilities for processing live data streams.
- Fault Tolerance
	- **Robust:** Re-executes failed tasks. Data is durable due to HDFS replication.
		- **Robust:** Recomputes lost partitions of [[RDD_Resilient_Distributed_Dataset|RDDs]]/DataFrames using lineage information (DAG). If cached data is lost, it can be recomputed.
- Ecosystem Integration
    - **Core of early Hadoop:** Tightly integrated with HDFS and YARN.
	    -   **Flexible:** Can run on YARN, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, or in standalone mode. Can read from/write to HDFS, S3, Cassandra, HBase, JDBC sources, etc.
- Interactive Analysis
    - **Poor:** High latency of MapReduce jobs makes interactive querying and data exploration difficult.
	    -   **Good:** Lower latency due to in-memory processing and optimized query execution (Spark SQL) makes it suitable for interactive shells and BI tools.
- Resource Management
    - Uses [[YARN|YARN]] (in Hadoop 2.x+).
	    -   Can use [[YARN|YARN]], Mesos, Kubernetes, or its own Standalone scheduler.
- Cost
    - Both are open source. Hardware costs for commodity clusters are similar. Spark might require more RAM for in-memory processing to achieve optimal performance.
	    - Development time might be lower with Spark due to higher-level APIs.

## Summary of Key Differences
-   **Speed:** Spark is generally much faster due to in-memory processing and optimized DAG execution.
-   **Data Handling:** MapReduce is primarily disk-based for intermediate data; Spark leverages memory extensively.
-   **Ease of Development:** Spark's APIs (especially DataFrame/SQL) are generally considered easier and more productive than writing raw MapReduce jobs.
-   **Versatility:** Spark supports a wider range of workloads (batch, streaming, interactive, ML, graph) within a single framework.
-   **Iterative Processing:** Spark excels at iterative tasks where MapReduce is inefficient.

**When Might MapReduce Still Be Considered?**
-   For extremely large batch jobs where the dataset vastly exceeds available cluster memory and disk I/O patterns are highly sequential, MapReduce's disk-based approach might still be robust, though Spark can also spill to disk.
-   Legacy systems or specific use cases where the MapReduce paradigm fits perfectly and performance is adequate.
-   When fine-grained control over the exact map and reduce physical execution (less common now) is absolutely needed.

In modern Big Data architectures, Spark has largely superseded Hadoop MapReduce as the preferred general-purpose processing engine due to its performance and versatility. However, Hadoop (HDFS for storage, YARN for resource management) often still forms the underlying platform on which Spark runs.
