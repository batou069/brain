# Spark Cluster Manager

A **Cluster Manager** in the context of Apache Spark is an external service responsible for acquiring and managing cluster resources (CPU, memory) that Spark applications need to run their [[Spark_Cluster_Architecture|Driver Program and Executors]]. Spark itself does not manage the physical cluster resources directly; it relies on a cluster mSpark_MLlibanager for this.

Spark supports several types of cluster managers, allowing it to run in various environments.

## Role of the Cluster Manager
-   **Resource Allocation:** The primary role is to allocate cluster resources (typically CPU cores and memory) to Spark applications. When a Spark application starts, its `SparkContext` connects to the cluster manager to request resources for its executors.
-   **Launching Executors:** The cluster manager is responsible for launching executor processes on the worker nodes of the cluster based on the resources allocated to an application.
-   **Monitoring Resources:** Keeps track of available and used resources across the cluster.
-   **Application Scheduling (sometimes):** Depending on the cluster manager, it might also handle scheduling of different applications competing for resources (e.g., YARN's schedulers).

## Supported Cluster Managers

[list2tab|#Cluster Manager Types]
- Standalone Mode
    -   **Description:** A simple cluster manager included with Spark. It's easy to set up and suitable for small Spark deployments or development/testing environments.
    -   **Components:**
        -   **Master:** A master daemon that manages worker nodes and allocates resources.
        -   **Worker:** Worker daemons running on each slave node, responsible for launching executors.
    -   **Pros:** Simple to set up, no external dependencies beyond Spark itself.
    -   **Cons:** Less feature-rich than YARN or Mesos (e.g., for resource sharing among different types of applications, advanced scheduling policies). Typically does not manage other (non-Spark) applications.
- Apache Mesos
    -   **Description:** A general-purpose distributed systems kernel that can manage diverse workloads, including Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and other applications.
    -   **How Spark uses it:** Spark runs as a Mesos framework. The Spark driver acts as a Mesos scheduler that registers with the Mesos master and requests resources. Mesos then offers resources on slave nodes to the Spark driver, which launches executors on them.
    -   **Pros:** Fine-grained resource sharing across different frameworks, supports dynamic resource allocation.
    -   **Cons:** Can be more complex to set up and manage than Standalone.
- Hadoop YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator)
    -   **Description:** The resource management layer of Hadoop 2.x and later (see [[YARN]]). Spark applications can run as YARN applications.
    -   **How Spark uses it:**
        -   **YARN Client Mode:** The Spark driver runs on the client machine (e.g., the machine submitting the job). The driver requests resources from YARN's ResourceManager, which launches the ApplicationMaster (AM) for the Spark application. The AM then negotiates for executor containers.
        -   **YARN Cluster Mode:** The Spark driver runs inside an ApplicationMaster process managed by YARN on the cluster. The client only submits the application and can then disconnect.
    -   **Pros:** Leverages existing Hadoop YARN clusters, good resource sharing with other Hadoop ecosystem applications (MapReduce, Hive, etc.), robust resource management and scheduling policies (CapacityScheduler, FairScheduler).
    -   **Cons:** Requires a Hadoop YARN cluster to be available.
- Kubernetes (K8s)
    -   **Description:** An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Spark can run on Kubernetes, with Spark components (driver, executors) running as Kubernetes pods.
    -   **How Spark uses it:** Spark submits a request to the Kubernetes API server to create a driver pod. The driver pod, once running, requests executor pods from Kubernetes.
    -   **Pros:** Leverages Kubernetes' powerful container orchestration capabilities, dynamic scaling, resource isolation, multi-tenancy, and integration with cloud-native ecosystems.
    -   **Cons:** Requires a Kubernetes cluster and familiarity with Kubernetes concepts.

## Choosing a Cluster Manager
The choice of cluster manager depends on:
-   **Existing Infrastructure:** If you already have a Hadoop YARN or Mesos cluster, running Spark on it is often a natural choice.
-   **Simplicity vs. Features:** Standalone is simple but less feature-rich. YARN, Mesos, and Kubernetes offer more advanced resource management and sharing capabilities but are more complex to set up and manage (unless using managed cloud services).
-   **Workload Diversity:** If you need to run various types of distributed applications (not just Spark), Mesos or Kubernetes might be more suitable as general-purpose managers. YARN is also increasingly supporting non-MapReduce/Spark workloads.
-   **Cloud Environments:** Kubernetes is becoming a de facto standard for container orchestration in the cloud, making it an attractive option for running Spark in cloud environments. Cloud providers also offer managed Spark services that often use YARN or Kubernetes underneath.

Spark's ability to work with different cluster managers provides flexibility in deploying Spark applications in diverse environments.
