# Bokeh MOC âœ¨ðŸ“Š

**Bokeh** is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It provides an elegant and concise way to construct versatile graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards and data applications.

Bokeh's strength lies in its ability to generate interactive HTML/JavaScript-based visualizations without requiring the user to write any JavaScript directly.

## Core Philosophy & Features
-   **Interactivity First:** Designed from the ground up for creating interactive plots (zoom, pan, hover, selection, widgets).
-   **Web-Based Output:** Renders graphics using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, making them suitable for embedding in web pages, Jupyter notebooks, or standalone HTML files.
-   **Multiple API Levels:**
    -   **`bokeh.plotting`:** A mid-level interface for creating common chart types by composing glyphs. This is often the primary interface used.
    -   **`bokeh.models`:** A low-level interface that provides maximum flexibility by allowing direct construction and manipulation of Bokeh's plot objects (models).
    -   High-level charting interfaces (like `bokeh.charts`, now deprecated) have been superseded by integration with libraries like HoloViews.
-   **Glyph-Based System:** Plots are constructed by adding "glyphs" (visual markers like circles, lines, rectangles, patches) to a figure. Each glyph has properties that can be mapped to data columns.
-   **Server Capability (`bokeh serve`):** Allows for building interactive data applications where Python code can react to UI events (e.g., widget changes, selections) and update plots dynamically.
-   **Handles Large Datasets (with Datashader):** Can integrate with Datashader for rendering very large datasets effectively by performing server-side aggregation before visualization.
-   **Extensible:** Allows for creating custom extensions and components.
