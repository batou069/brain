# Beautiful Soup: Parsing HTML/XML Documents

The first step in using Beautiful Soup is to parse an HTML or XML document into a `BeautifulSoup` object. This object represents the parsed document as a tree structure that can then be navigated and searched.

Beautiful Soup itself is not a parser; it relies on an underlying parser library.

## Creating a `BeautifulSoup` Object
You create a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing two arguments to its constructor:
1.  **The markup to be parsed:** This can be a string containing the HTML/XML content, or an open file handle.
2.  **The name of the parser to use:**
    -   `'html.parser'`: Python's built-in HTML parser. Decent speed, reasonably lenient. No external dependencies.
    -   `'lxml'`: A very fast and lenient HTML and XML parser. Requires `lxml` to be installed (`pip install lxml`). Often recommended for speed and robustness.
    -   `'lxml-xml'`: For parsing XML specifically with `lxml`.
    -   `'html5lib'`: An extremely lenient HTML parser that aims to parse HTML exactly like a web browser. It creates valid HTML5. Slower than `lxml` but very robust for messy HTML. Requires `html5lib` to be installed (`pip install html5lib`).

**Syntax:**
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# soup = BeautifulSoup(markup_string, "parser_name")
# soup = BeautifulSoup(open_file_handle, "parser_name")
```

## Example: Parsing an HTML String

Let's assume we have the following HTML content for a simple product listing page. This content would typically be fetched using a library like [[Requests_Library|`requests`]].

```python
import requests # For fetching web page content
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Conceptual: Fetching HTML content from a URL
# url = "http://example-ecommerce.com/products/widget"
# try:
#     response = requests.get(url)
#     response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for HTTP errors (4xx or 5xx)
#     html_content = response.text
# except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
#     print(f"Error fetching URL: {e}")
#     # Fallback HTML content for demonstration if request fails
html_content = """
<html>
<head><title>Awesome Widget Product Page</title></head>
<body>
    <div class="product-details">
        <h1 id="product-name">Awesome Widget X1000</h1>
        <p class="price">Price: <span class="amount">$29.99</span></p>
        <p class="description">This is a truly amazing widget with cutting-edge features. Perfect for all your widgeting needs!</p>

            <li>Weight: 200g</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="reviews">
            <div class="review">
                <h4>Great product!</h4>
                <p>By User1 on 2023-10-01</p>
                <p class="review-text">I love this widget, it works perfectly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="review">
                <h4>Could be better</h4>
                <p>By User2 on 2023-10-05</p>

# 1. Create a BeautifulSoup object using Python's built-in html.parser
# soup_html_parser = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
# print("--- Parsed with html.parser ---")
# print(soup_html_parser.title.string if soup_html_parser.title else "No title")

# 2. Create a BeautifulSoup object using lxml (generally preferred if installed)
# try:
#     soup_lxml = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'lxml')
#     print("\n--- Parsed with lxml ---")
#     print(soup_lxml.find('h1').string if soup_lxml.find('h1') else "No H1")
# except ImportError:
#     print("\nlxml parser not installed. Skipping lxml example.")
#     soup_lxml = None # Define it so later conceptual examples don't break

# 3. Create a BeautifulSoup object using html5lib (very robust for broken HTML)
# try:
#     soup_html5lib = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html5lib')
#     print("\n--- Parsed with html5lib ---")
#     price_span = soup_html5lib.select_one('span.amount')
#     print(price_span.string if price_span else "No price span")
# except ImportError:
#     print("\nhtml5lib parser not installed. Skipping html5lib example.")

# For subsequent examples, we'll assume 'soup' is a parsed BeautifulSoup object
# (e.g., soup = soup_lxml or soup_html_parser)
# For demonstration, let's ensure 'soup' is defined for conceptual examples even if parsing fails
if 'soup_html_parser' in locals() and soup_html_parser:
    soup = soup_html_parser
elif 'soup_lxml' in locals() and soup_lxml:
    soup = soup_lxml
else: # Fallback if no parser worked or for minimal execution
    soup = BeautifulSoup("<html><body><p>Fallback content</p></body></html>", 'html.parser')
    print("\n--- Using Fallback Soup Object ---")

# Now 'soup' holds the parsed tree structure of the HTML.
# We can navigate and search it using BeautifulSoup methods.
# print("\nExample: Product Name from parsed soup object:", soup.find(id="product-name").string if soup.find(id="product-name") else "Product name not found")
```

## Choosing a Parser
-   **`html.parser`**: Good default, built-in, decent performance.
-   **`lxml`**: Usually the fastest and also very lenient with broken HTML. Often the best choice if you can install it. It can also parse XML.
-   **`html5lib`**: The most "browser-like" in how it handles malformed HTML, ensuring it creates a valid HTML5 structure. It's slower than `lxml` but extremely robust. Use this if you encounter HTML that other parsers struggle with.

If no parser is specified, Beautiful Soup will pick the best one available on the system, but it's good practice to specify one explicitly to ensure consistent behavior across environments.

Once the document is parsed into a `BeautifulSoup` object, you can proceed to [[BS4_Navigating_Tree|navigate]] and [[BS4_Searching_Tree|search]] this tree.
