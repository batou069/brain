# TensorFlow MOC ðŸ”¥ðŸ§ 

**TensorFlow** is an open-source end-to-end platform for machine learning, with a particular strength in **deep learning** and **neural networks**. It was developed by the Google Brain team and offers a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources.

TensorFlow allows developers to build and deploy ML-powered applications across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, mobile, web).

## Core Philosophy & Features
-   **Computational Graphs:** TensorFlow traditionally used a static computation graph model (Define-and-Run), though Eager Execution (Define-by-Run, similar to PyTorch) is now the default in TensorFlow 2.x, making it more Pythonic and easier to debug.
-   **Tensors:** The fundamental data structure in TensorFlow is the "tensor," a multi-dimensional array similar to [[_NumPy_MOC|NumPy arrays]].
-   **Scalability:** Designed for large-scale distributed training and inference.
-   **Flexibility:** Supports building a wide range of models, from simple linear regression to complex deep neural networks for computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, etc.
-   **[[Keras_Library|Keras API]]:** TensorFlow has adopted Keras as its official high-level API for building and training neural networks, making model development more user-friendly.
-   **Ecosystem (TensorFlow Extended - TFX):** Provides tools for the full MLOps lifecycle, including data ingestion (`tf.data`), model building (`tf.keras`), training, evaluation, deployment (`TensorFlow Serving`, `TensorFlow Lite` for mobile/IoT, `TensorFlow.js` for web).
-   **Automatic Differentiation:** Crucial for training neural networks via backpropagation (`tf.GradientTape`).
-   **Hardware Acceleration:** Strong support for GPUs and Google's TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for accelerating training and inference.
