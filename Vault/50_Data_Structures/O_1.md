# O(1) - Constant Complexity

## Definition

**O(1)** denotes **constant complexity**. An algorithm or operation takes O(1) time or space if its resource usage (time or memory) **does not depend** on the size of the input (`n`). It requires roughly the same amount of time or space regardless of how large the input is.

## Key Aspects

- **Time:** Constant time means the number of basic steps executed is constant (or bounded by a constant).
- **Space:** Constant space means the amount of extra memory used (beyond the input itself) is constant.
- **Fastest Growth Rate:** This is the most efficient complexity class in terms of scalability.

## Examples

- **Time Complexity O(1):**
    - Accessing an element in an [[Array_C]] or [[Vector_DS]] by its index (`array[i]`).
    - Pushing or popping an element onto/from a [[Stack_ADT]] (implemented with array or linked list).
    - Enqueuing or dequeuing from a [[Queue_ADT]] (with efficient implementation, e.g., linked list with tail pointer or circular array).
    - Inserting/deleting/accessing in a [[Hash_Table_DS]] (on average, assuming good hash function and load factor).
    - Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    - Simple assignments.
- **Space Complexity O(1):**
    - Algorithms that operate in-place or use only a fixed number of auxiliary variables, regardless of input size (e.g., swapping two variables, finding the maximum element in an array without creating copies).
