# Scrum

## Definition

**Scrum** is an **[[Agile_Development|agile]] framework** for managing complex knowledge work, most commonly software development. It provides a lightweight process framework that emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. Scrum is **not** a full process or methodology itself, but rather a framework within which various processes and techniques can be employed.

## Key Components

Scrum is defined by its roles, events (ceremonies), artifacts, and rules.

**1. Roles:**
    - **[[Product_Owner]]:** Represents the stakeholders and the voice of the customer. Responsible for managing the [[Product_Backlog]] and maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.
    - **[[Development_Team]]:** A cross-functional, self-organizing team of professionals (developers, testers, designers, etc.) who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each [[Sprint]]. Typically 3-9 members.
    - **[[Scrum_Master]]:** A servant-leader responsible for ensuring the Scrum framework is understood and enacted. Helps the team follow Scrum practices, facilitates events, removes impediments, and coaches the team and organization.

**2. Events (Ceremonies):**
    - **[[Sprint]]:** A time-box (typically 1-4 weeks) during which a "Done," usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations.
    - **Sprint Planning:** Event at the start of a Sprint where the Scrum Team collaborates to define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how the work will be achieved. Output: [[Sprint_Backlog]] and Sprint Goal.
    - **[[Daily_Scrum]] (Daily Stand-up):** A short (15-minute) daily meeting for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. Often structured around: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? What impediments are in my way?
    - **[[Sprint_Review]]:** Held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the [[Product_Backlog]] if needed. The Development Team demonstrates the work that is "Done," and the Scrum Team collaborates with stakeholders on next steps.
    - **[[Sprint_Retrospective]]:** Held after the Sprint Review and before the next Sprint Planning. An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint (inspecting people, relationships, process, tools).

**3. Artifacts:**
    - **[[Product_Backlog]]:** An ordered list of everything known to be needed in the product (features, functions, requirements, enhancements, fixes). Managed by the [[Product_Owner]]. It is dynamic and evolves.
    - **[[Sprint_Backlog]]:** The set of [[Product_Backlog]] items selected for the [[Sprint]], plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. Managed by the [[Development_Team]].
    - **Increment:** The sum of all [[Product_Backlog]] items completed during a [[Sprint]] and all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done" (meeting the Definition of Done) and potentially releasable.

**4. Rules:** The Scrum Guide defines rules that bind the roles, events, and artifacts together, governing their relationships and interactions.

## Key Principles

- **Empiricism:** Based on transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Progress is made via short cycles and learning from results.
- **Self-Organization:** Development Teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.
- **Cross-Functional Teams:** Development Teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.
- **Time-boxing:** Events have maximum durations to ensure focus and minimize waste.
- **Iterative & Incremental Development:** Work proceeds in Sprints, producing potentially shippable increments.
