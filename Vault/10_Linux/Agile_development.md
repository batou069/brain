# Agile Development

## Definition

**Agile Development** (or Agile Software Development) is an umbrella term for a set of **principles and practices** for software development based on iterative and incremental development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It emphasizes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

## Core Philosophy ([[Agile_Manifesto]])

Agile development is guided by the values and principles of the **Manifesto for Agile Software Development** (2001), which prioritizes:

**Values:**
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

*(While there is value in the items on the right, Agile values the items on the left more.)*

**Principles (Selected):**
- Highest priority is customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
- Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
- Business people and developers must work together daily.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- Regularly reflect on how to become more effective, then tune and adjust behavior accordingly.

## Key Characteristics

- **[[Iterative_Development|Iterative]]:** Work proceeds in short cycles (iterations or [[Sprint|Sprints]]), with feedback gathered at the end of each cycle.
- **[[Incremental_Development|Incremental]]:** Working software is delivered in small increments, with each increment building upon the previous ones.
- **Adaptive:** Embraces change; plans are flexible and expected to evolve.
- **Collaborative:** Strong emphasis on communication and collaboration among team members and with stakeholders/customers.
- **Customer Focus:** Aims to deliver value to the customer frequently.
- **Empirical:** Relies on feedback loops, inspection, and adaptation rather than rigid upfront planning.
- **Focus on People:** Values motivated individuals, self-organization, and sustainable pace.

## Agile Frameworks/Methodologies

Agile is a philosophy; specific frameworks implement its principles:
- **[[Scrum]]:** A popular framework focusing on iterative Sprints, specific roles, events, and artifacts.
- **[[Kanban]]:** Focuses on visualizing workflow, limiting work-in-progress (WIP), and managing flow.
- **[[Extreme_Programming]] (XP):** Emphasizes technical practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, and simple design.
- Lean Software Development
- Crystal Methods
- Feature Driven Development (FDD)

## Contrast with Waterfall

Agile contrasts sharply with the traditional [[Waterfall]] model, which is sequential, predictive, documentation-heavy, and resistant to change. Agile is iterative, adaptive, emphasizes working software, and welcomes change.
