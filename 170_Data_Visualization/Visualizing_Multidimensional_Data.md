# Visualizing Multidimensional Data

Visualizing data with more than two or three variables (multidimensional or high-dimensional data) presents a significant challenge because our primary visual media (screens, paper) are 2D. However, various techniques exist to represent multiple dimensions in a single plot or a series of related plots.

>[!question] How many different dimensions can we visualize in a single plot?
>Effectively, in a single static 2D plot, humans can typically perceive and distinguish:
>1.  **X-position** (1st dimension)
>2.  **Y-position** (2nd dimension)
>3.  **Size** of markers (3rd dimension)
>4.  **Color** (hue, saturation, or lightness) of markers/lines (4th dimension)
>5.  **Shape** of markers (5th dimension, best for categorical)
>
>Beyond these, adding more visual encodings (like texture, orientation, or complex glyphs) can quickly lead to cognitive overload and make the plot difficult to interpret. So, while theoretically more can be encoded, **3 to 5 dimensions are a practical limit for clear interpretation in a single static 2D scatter-like plot.**
>
>Using techniques like **small multiples (facet grids)** or **animation (for time as a dimension)** can help visualize more dimensions by breaking down the problem or introducing temporal change. 3D plots directly add a Z-position but can suffer from occlusion and perspective issues.

## Techniques for Visualizing Multidimensional Data

[list2tab|#Multidimensional Viz Tech]
- 1. Encoding Additional Dimensions in 2D Plots
    - **For [[Scatter_Plot|Scatter Plots]] / Bubble Charts:**
        - **Size:** Vary the size of markers to represent a third numerical dimension (Bubble Chart).
        - **Color:**
            - Use color hue for a categorical dimension.
            - Use color intensity/saturation (sequential or diverging colormaps) for a numerical dimension.
        - **Shape:** Use different marker shapes for a categorical dimension (limited number of distinct shapes).
        - **Alpha (Transparency):** Can sometimes indicate density or another numerical variable, but use with caution.
    - **Example:** A scatter plot of `(X, Y)` where point `size` represents `Dimension3`, point `color` represents `Dimension4 (numerical)`, and point `shape` represents `Dimension5 (categorical)`.
- 2. Scatter Plot Matrix (Pair Plot)
	[[Scatter_Plot_Matrix|Scatter Plot Matrix (Pair Plot)]]
    - **Concept:** A grid of scatter plots, where each plot shows the relationship between a pair of variables in the dataset. The diagonal often shows histograms or density plots of individual variables.
    - **Usefulness:** Good for getting an overview of all pairwise relationships in a dataset with a moderate number of numerical variables (e.g., up to 10-15).
    - **Tools:** `seaborn.pairplot()`, `pandas.plotting.scatter_matrix()`.
- 3. Heatmap
	-[[Heatmap|Heatmap]]
    - **Concept:** Represents a matrix of data where values are depicted by color intensity. Can visualize 3 dimensions: two categorical/discrete dimensions for rows/columns, and one numerical dimension for color intensity (e.g., correlation matrix).
    - **Usefulness:** Good for showing patterns in matrices or relationships between two categorical variables based on a numerical measure.
- 4. Parallel Coordinates Plot
	[[Parallel_Coordinates_Plot|Parallel **Coordinates** Plot]]
    - **Concept:** Each variable is represented by a parallel vertical axis. An observation (data point) is represented as a polyline that connects its values on each axis.
    - **Usefulness:** Can display many dimensions simultaneously. Patterns emerge from how lines cluster or cross. Good for identifying clusters and relationships, but can get cluttered with many observations.
- 5. Radar Chart (Spider Chart)
	[[Radar_Chart|Radar Chart (Spider Chart)]]
    - **Concept:** Multiple quantitative variables are represented on axes starting from the same central point. Values are plotted along each axis and connected to form a polygon.
    - **Usefulness:** Comparing multiple quantitative variables for a single observation or a small number of observations. Often used for comparing profiles or performance metrics. Can be misleading if axes scales are not carefully considered or if areas are misinterpreted.
- 6. 3D Plots
    - **Concept:** Directly plots data in three spatial dimensions (X, Y, Z). Common types include 3D scatter plots, surface plots, 3D bar charts, 3D line plots.
    - **Usefulness:** Can reveal structures not visible in 2D.
    - **Challenges:** Occlusion (points hiding other points), difficulty in perceiving depth and exact values, interpretation depends heavily on viewing angle. Interactivity (rotation) is often crucial.
    - **Tools:** `matplotlib.pyplot.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')`.
- 7. Faceting / Small Multiples / Trellis Display
    - **Concept:** Create a grid of smaller, similar plots, where each plot shows a subset of the data conditioned on the values of one or more categorical variables.
    - **Usefulness:** Excellent for comparing trends and patterns across different categories or conditions while keeping individual plots simple.
    - **Tools:** `seaborn.FacetGrid`, `seaborn.relplot/displot/catplot(col=..., row=...)`, Matplotlib subplots.
- 8. Glyphs / Chernoff Faces
    - **Concept:** Represent each multi-dimensional data point as a single complex visual object (glyph) where different features of the glyph (e.g., shape, size, color, orientation of parts) encode different data dimensions. Chernoff faces use facial features.
    - **Usefulness:** Can encode many dimensions, but interpretation can be subjective and requires learning the mapping. Less common in general data analysis.
- 9. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques as a Precursor
	[[Dimensionality_Reduction|Dimensionality Reduction Techniques]]
    - **Concept:** Reduce the number of variables to 2 or 3 principal dimensions that capture most of the variance or structure in the data, and then visualize these reduced dimensions.
    - **Techniques:** [[Principal_Component_Analysis_PCA|PCA]], t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
    - **Usefulness:** Essential for visualizing the overall structure of very high-dimensional data (e.g., embeddings, gene expression data). The new dimensions are combinations of original ones.

## Challenges
- **Cognitive Load:** Humans have limits on how much information they can process simultaneously. Too many visual encodings can be overwhelming.
- **Occlusion:** In 3D plots or dense 2D plots, data points can obscure each other.
- **Interpretation Complexity:** Relationships in higher dimensions can be non-intuitive.
- **Curse of Dimensionality:** As dimensions increase, the data becomes increasingly sparse, and concepts like distance can become less meaningful.

Choosing the right technique depends on the specific dataset, the number of dimensions, the types of variables, and the analytical goals. Often, a combination of techniques or interactive exploration is necessary.
