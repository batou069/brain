# Mathematics MOC

This section covers fundamental mathematical concepts essential for understanding and working in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.

## Core Areas
- [[150_Mathematics/Calculus/_Calculus_MOC|Calculus]]
- [[150_Mathematics/Linear_Algebra/_Linear_Algebra_MOC|Linear Algebra (Vectors & Matrices)]]
- [[150_Mathematics/Functions/_Functions_MOC|Mathematical Functions]]

## Overview
Mathematics provides the language and tools to describe, analyze, and solve complex problems encountered in AI. Key areas include:
- **[[150_Mathematics/Calculus/_Calculus_MOC|Calculus]]:** Deals with rates of change ([[Calculus_Derivatives|Derivatives]]) and accumulation ([[Calculus_Integrals|Integrals]]). Essential for [[Calculus_Optimization|Optimization]] algorithms used in training machine learning models. [[Matrix_Calculus]], [[Hessian]], and [[Jacobian]] extend these concepts to multiple dimensions.
- **[[150_Mathematics/Linear_Algebra/_Linear_Algebra_MOC|Linear Algebra]]:** The study of [[Vector|vectors]], [[Matrix|matrices]], and linear transformations. Data is often represented as vectors and matrices, and many ML algorithms are based on linear algebraic operations like [[Matrix_Product|matrix multiplication]], [[Eigenvalues_Eigenvectors|eigen-decomposition]], and [[Singular_Value_Decomposition|singular value decomposition]]. Concepts like [[Dot_Product|dot products]], [[p-norm|norms]], and [[Cosine_Similarity|cosine similarity]] are fundamental for measuring relationships and distances.
- **[[150_Mathematics/Functions/_Functions_MOC|Mathematical Functions]]:** Various functions like [[Polynomials|polynomials]], [[Exponential_Function|exponential]], [[Logarithmic_Function|logarithmic]], [[Trigonometric_Functions|trigonometric]], [[Hyperbolic_Functions|hyperbolic]], [[Sigmoid_Function|sigmoid]], [[Softmax_Function|softmax]], and [[Gamma_Function|gamma functions]] serve as building blocks for models, activation functions in neural networks, or describe data distributions.

A strong grasp of these mathematical foundations is critical for developing intuition, understanding algorithm mechanics, and innovating in the field of AI.
