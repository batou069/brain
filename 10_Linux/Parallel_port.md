# Parallel Port

## Definition

A **Parallel Port** is a type of interface found on computers for connecting peripherals, characterized by its ability to transmit multiple [[bits]] of data **simultaneously** (in parallel) over multiple wires within the cable. This contrasts with a [[Serial_port]], which transmits one bit at a time. The most common type of parallel port on PCs is the printer port conforming to the [[Centronics_Port|Centronics]] standard or later [[IEEE_1284]] standards.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Parallel Transmission:** Sends multiple data bits (typically 8 bits, or one byte) at once across dedicated data lines. Also includes control and status lines.
- **Speed (Historically):** Was generally faster than contemporary [[Serial_port|serial ports]] for bulk data transfer due to parallel transmission, although clock speeds were low. Modern serial interfaces like [[USB]] and Ethernet are much faster.
- **Primary Use:** Most commonly used for connecting printers (hence often called the "printer port" or "LPT port" - Line Print Terminal).
- **Other Uses:** Also used for external devices like scanners, external drives (Zip drives), hardware protection dongles, and even early networking (Direct Cable Connection).
- **Connectors:** Typically used a large DB-25 female connector on the PC side and a 36-pin Centronics connector on the printer side (older standard) or DB-25/Mini-Centronics (IEEE 1284).
- **[[IEEE_1284]] Standard:** An updated standard that defined different modes of operation, including bidirectional communication (allowing data transfer back from the peripheral) and higher speeds (ECP - Extended Capabilities Port, EPP - Enhanced Parallel Port).
- **Legacy Interface:** Largely replaced by [[USB]] for printers and most other peripherals due to USB's higher speed, smaller connectors, hot-plugging, and ease of use. Rarely found on modern consumer PCs.
