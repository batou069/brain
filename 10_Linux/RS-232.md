# RS-232

## Definition

**RS-232 (Recommended Standard 232)** is a standard originally introduced in 1960 for **serial communication** transmission of data. It formally defines the signals connecting between DTE (Data Terminal Equipment), such as a computer terminal or PC [[Serial_port]], and DCE (Data Circuit-terminating Equipment or Data Communication Equipment), such as a [[Modem]]. The standard defines the electrical characteristics, signal timing, signal meanings, connector types (like [[DB-9]] and [[DB-25]]), and pinouts.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Serial Communication Standard:** Defines how to transmit data one bit at a time.
- **Point-to-Point:** Designed for connecting two devices directly.
- **Voltage Levels:** Defines specific voltage levels for representing logic 1 (Mark, typically -3V to -15V) and logic 0 (Space, typically +3V to +15V), as well as control signals. These are different from standard TTL/CMOS logic levels inside a computer.
- **Signal Lines:** Defines various signal lines beyond just Transmit Data (TxD) and Receive Data (RxD), including control lines for hardware flow control (RTS - Request To Send, CTS - Clear To Send), modem status lines (DSR - Data Set Ready, DCD - Data Carrier Detect, DTR - Data Terminal Ready, RI - Ring Indicator), and grounds (Signal Ground, Protective Ground). Not all lines are always used, especially in simpler connections (e.g., 3-wire: TxD, RxD, GND).
- **Connectors:** Commonly associated with [[DB-25]] (25-pin) and later [[DB-9]] (9-pin) D-subminiature connectors.
- **Asynchronous/Synchronous:** Can support both, but most common PC implementations are asynchronous (using start/stop bits managed by a [[UART]]).
- **Limitations:**
    - **Speed:** Original standard limited, though implementations went faster (e.g., 115200 bps).
    - **Distance:** Voltage levels limit cable length (officially ~15 meters/50 feet, though often usable further at lower speeds).
    - **Noise Susceptibility:** Single-ended signaling makes it susceptible to noise.
    - **Voltage Levels:** Not directly compatible with internal logic levels, requiring level shifter ICs (like MAX232).
- **Applications:** Historically used for modems, terminals, serial mice, printers. Still common for industrial control systems, scientific instruments, embedded system debug/console ports, network device console ports.
