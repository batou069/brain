# HTTPS (HTTP Secure)

## Definition

**HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)** is an extension of the [[HTTP]] protocol used for secure communication over a computer network, primarily the [[World_Wide_Web]]. HTTPS communication is encrypted using **Transport Layer Security ([[TLS]])** or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer ([[SSL]]). It provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.

## Key Aspects / Characteristics

- **Secure Communication:** Provides a secure channel over an insecure network like the Internet.
- **Encryption ([[Confidentiality]]):** Encrypts the HTTP request and response data (including headers and body) between the client (browser) and the server. Prevents eavesdroppers from easily reading the transmitted information (like passwords, credit card numbers, personal data).
- **Integrity:** Uses message authentication codes (MACs) generated by TLS/SSL to ensure that the data has not been tampered with or altered during transmission.
- **Authentication:** Typically authenticates the **server** to the client using public key [[Certificates|SSL/TLS certificates]] issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). This helps the client verify they are connecting to the legitimate server and not an imposter (preventing man-in-the-middle attacks). Client authentication (where the server verifies the client's identity) is also possible but less common for general web browsing.
- **Protocol Layering:** HTTPS is not a separate protocol but rather standard HTTP layered *on top of* the secure TLS/SSL protocol, which itself runs on top of [[TCP]].
    `HTTP -> TLS/SSL -> TCP -> IP`
- **[[Port_(Networking)|Port Number]]:** Uses TCP port **443** by default (whereas HTTP uses port 80).
- **[[URL]] Scheme:** URLs begin with `https://` instead of `http://`.
- **Ubiquitous:** Now the standard for almost all web traffic, especially involving logins, financial transactions, or sensitive data. Browsers often flag non-HTTPS sites as "Not Secure". HTTP/2 effectively requires HTTPS for browser implementations.

## How it Works (Simplified Handshake)

1.  Client connects to server on port 443.
2.  Client sends TLS "ClientHello" message (supported TLS versions, cipher suites, etc.).
3.  Server responds with "ServerHello" (chosen cipher suite, etc.) and its **SSL/TLS Certificate**.
4.  Client verifies the server's certificate (checks validity, hostname, trusted CA).
5.  Client and server perform a key exchange process (e.g., using RSA or Diffie-Hellman) based on the chosen cipher suite to securely establish shared **session keys**.
6.  Client sends "Finished" message, encrypted with the session key.
7.  Server sends "Finished" message, encrypted with the session key.
8.  **Secure channel established.** Client and server now encrypt/decrypt subsequent HTTP data using the agreed-upon session keys and algorithms.
